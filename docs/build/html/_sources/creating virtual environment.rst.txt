LET'S GET STARTED 

Getting started with this project requires a couple of easy to follow steps
we need to set up our environment --setting up environment simply means to create 
a unique place for the project. 

It is a good idea to create a virtual environment for each project. Although, this is not 
a compulsory requirement, but doing so helps to have a project with its unique dependencies and packages

--so, Let us create a virtual environment
step 1
create a folder <name> -- in this case, example folder name to create is OQC_TEST
open the command line and navigave into this folder.

step 2
install the virtual environment package by running this command
$ pip install virtualenv 

step 3
create virtual environment by running this command
$ virtualenv env 

NOTE -> Kindly note that the env is the name of the virtual environment 
that you want to create. It is recommended to use a simple name.
it is a common practice to use env which means environment

step 4
activating the virtual environment that we have just created
run the command 
$ env\scripts\activate
if this command executes successfully, the path in your command line will be prefixed with (env)

We have now successfully created our virtual environment
