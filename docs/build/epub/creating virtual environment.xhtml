  <p>LET’S GET STARTED</p>
<p>Getting started with this project requires a couple of easy to follow steps
we need to set up our environment –setting up environment simply means to create
a unique place for the project.</p>
<p>It is a good idea to create a virtual environment for each project. Although, this is not
a compulsory requirement, but doing so helps to have a project with its unique dependencies and packages</p>
<p>–so, Let us create a virtual environment
step 1
create a folder &lt;name&gt; – in this case, example folder name to create is OQC_TEST
open the command line and navigave into this folder.</p>
<p>step 2
install the virtual environment package by running this command
$ pip install virtualenv</p>
<p>step 3
create virtual environment by running this command
$ virtualenv env</p>
<p>NOTE -&gt; Kindly note that the env is the name of the virtual environment
that you want to create. It is recommended to use a simple name.
it is a common practice to use env which means environment</p>
<p>step 4
activating the virtual environment that we have just created
run the command
$ envscriptsactivate
if this command executes successfully, the path in your command line will be prefixed with (env)</p>
<p>We have now successfully created our virtual environment</p>
